## Reporting a Bug

The `Aquila` team take all security bugs seriously.
Thank you for improving the security, we appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible.
